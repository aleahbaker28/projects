🔩 Precision 3D Component Design & Blueprint Development
📌 Project Overview

This project showcases my ability to create a high-accuracy 3D mechanical component using CAD software (SolidWorks and AutoCAD), with a complete set of technical documentation. It was completed as part of my coursework at Tennessee College of Applied Technology (TCAT) in the Computer Aided Design Technology program.

The main goal of this project was to follow industry drafting standards to produce a fully manufacturable part with detailed blueprints, accurate dimensions, and proper tolerancing.
